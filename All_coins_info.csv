The Bytecent project was conceived to bring sanity back to an industry that has drifted away from the core principles set forth with the original Bitcoin project.</span></p><p>Bytecent is not just another digital currency in a sea of many; it is a philosophy born out of necessity. The goal of this project is to reinvent digital currencies from the manner that wallets are distributed and installed, to the method that coins are earned and spent. Bytecent is the first user-friendly digital currency designed from the ground up to be as easy as sending an email. If you can point and click a mouse, you can use Bytecent.</p><p><span><span>Bytecent is the first user-friendly digital currency designed from the ground up to be as easy as sending an email. If you can point and click a mouse, you can use Bytecent. Unlike with other digital currencies, Bytecent does not require any special hardware or configurations to mine. Simply download the software, install it, and begin mining today! ""Mining"" is lingo for discovering new Bytecent, similar to panning for gold. In actuality, mining is simply the process used to verify Bytecent transactions on the network.There are approximately 1440 coins generated per day, so finding new Bytecent can take a few hours or a few days depending on the speed of your computer. Mining Bytecent is fun and allows anyone with no mining experience or technical knowhow to begin mining immediately! Similar to conventional currencies, Bytecent is a currency that can be used to buy goods and services. You can offer your goods or services in return for payment in Bytecent.</span></span></p>",1 block,Webpagecoinp,"<p><strong>No Personal Information Required</strong> Unlike with credit cards and other forms of electronic payments, Bytecent does not require you to input personal information. Risk of privacy intrusion and ID theft is completely eliminated with Bytecent. Furthermore, compared to bank transactions, all you need to complete a transaction is the free Bytecent wallet and a unique Bytecent address.</p><p><strong>No Credit Checks</strong> Bytecent eliminates the need for credit checks and lengthy credit applications. Whether the end-user has excellent credit, bad credit or no credit, anyone can use Bytecent. You will never be denied or restricted from using Bytecent.</p><p>I<strong>mmediate Transactions</strong> Money transfer services and bank wire transfers can be costly, and transaction times can vary from a few minutes to a few days. Bytecent solves this problem by allowing anyone to send funds quickly to any person worldwide, without the hassle of dealing with banks or money transfer services. The average Bytecent transaction is completed within 60 seconds or less!</p><p><strong>No Transaction Limitations</strong> Whether you are sending 1 Bytecent or 100000 Bytecent, the amount you are sending does not matter. There are no limitations on the amount of Bytecent you can send at one time, nor are there any daily or monthly transaction limits. You have the freedom to conduct as many transactions as you desire.</p><p><strong>Unauthorized Transaction Prevention</strong> With Bytecent, you do not need to be concerned with criminals gaining access to your Bytecent address, and going on a shopping spree at your expense. The ""sender"" initiates all transactions, and transactions cannot be performed remotely by a 3rd party.

This way, the name, like the hash function itself, contains a mix of Austrian and Danish influences. The pronunciation of Grøstl may seem challenging.

349,,BLAKE256,/coins/dcr/,0,0.0,,0,,"<p>Decred is an open, progressive, and self-funding cryptocurrency with a system of community-based governance integrated into its blockchain. At its core is a hybridized proof-of-work proof-of-stake (PoW/PoS) consensus system that aims to strike a balance between PoW miners and PoS voters to create a more robust notion of consensus. The project is a result of the theoretical proposals brought by proof-of-activity (PoA) and MC2 in 2013. Decred development started in April, 2014 with a single developer and expanded to include developers from btcsuite shortly thereafter.</p><p>Decred is built in the spirit of open participation and we have provided below a full disclosure of the technical features of the system, wallets and mining, initial funding and distribution, project governance and development, and a group contribution timeline.</p><p><span>Decred opted for a different funding model in an attempt to shift the risk carried by supporters to the developers of the project. Instead of asking interested parties to fund the development of the software, the developers decided to pool funds together and carry the project to completion before making it public. The consensus was that this is an ethical path given the realities of funding software development, due to the fact that the developers alone carry the risk of the project failing, whereas in the past potential users were expected to pay for coins before any code was written. We felt this was unjust.</span></p><p><span>The development of Decred was funded by Company 0 and from the pockets of its developers individually. The cost of developing the project, in terms of developer pay, totals to approximately USD 250,000, which Company 0 paid to developers. An additional amount of approximately USD 165,000 has been allocated for unpaid work and individual purchases by developers. We felt that the most equitable way to handle compensation for these expenses was to perform a small premine as part of the project launch. The model is unusual in that no developer received any amount of coins for free - all coins owned by developers will either be purchased at a rate of USD 0.49 per coin from their own pockets or exchanged for work performed at the same rate.</span></p><p><span>The premine consists of 8% of the total supply of 21 million coins, meaning the premine consists of 1.68 million coins. Rather than allocating the entire premine to the bring-up costs, we decided to split the premine equally between compensation for bring-up and an ""airdrop"", where we freely give an equal amount of coins to a number of airdrop participants. This means Company 0 and its developers will have put roughly USD 415,000 into the bring-up since April, 2014 and receive 4% of the total supply, 840,000 coins (at USD 0.49 per coin). The remaining 4% will be spread evenly across a list of airdrop participants as part of an effort to build the Decred network and decentralize its distribution.  Coins held by Company 0 will be used to fund its ongoing work on open-source projects, such as Decred and btcsuite.</span></p><p><span>Giving away these coins in an airdrop allows us to accomplish several things at once for the project: enlarge the Decred network, further help decentralize the distribution of coins, and allow us to get coins into the hands of people who are interested in participating in the project. Decred is fundamentally about technological progress, so the airdrop will target individuals that have made contributions to advance technology in its various forms. The maximum number of airdrop participants is capped at 5,000 individuals, so we recommend registering sooner rather than later. These coins will be given away unconditionally and there is zero expectation of Decred receiving anything from you in return for these coins.</span></p><p><span>Sign up for the airdrop is currently open, but the airdrop registration will commence on January 4th, 2016. People who have been selected to participate in the airdrop will receive an email that contains a link to a web registration form. This form will require airdrop participants to enter an address to which their coins can be sent. Binaries and source code will be made available so that you can generate a wallet seed and an address for your airdrop coins. Once you have entered your receiving address into the airdrop webform and submitted it, you will receive your coins on the projected launch date.</span></p>",,Webpagecoinp,"<p><span>In addition to the technical features that make up the technology, Decred as a project introduces several development and governance features and proposals to ensure and steer long-term growth.

A budget, location, before and after images and a short description will be entered. The user then either donates the project amount or makes some initial donation. If she doesn’t cover the budget herself, she then begins a traditional crowdfunding campaign. Donations are received and within thirty days the minimum threshold is reached or the funds are returned. Once the threshold is reached, the project is again reviewed and confirmed. If necessary, the project founder is notified that any permits or other legal permissions are needed from the state or appropriate parties. The total budget for the project is 87% of total donations. 3% is reserved for credit card and handling fees, 10% goes to direct purchase of ROOTS tokens on the open market, increasing token demand. 87% is a higher project spend rate than most charitable organizations are capable of delivering, and in line with major international organizations. When everything is confirmed and ready to go, RootProject assigns a project foreman – a paid employee or contractor – and a budget for materials, tools and labor, aiming to hire a team that can finish the project in one day, if reasonable.

A decentralized application is an application which serves some specific purpose to its users, but which has the important property that the application itself does not depend on any specific party existing. Rather than serving as a front-end for selling or providing a specific party&#39;s services, a Đapp is a tool for people and organizations on different sides of an interaction use to come together without any centralized intermediary.</p><p>Contracts generally serve four purposes:</p><p>- Maintain a data store representing something which is useful to either other contracts or to the outside world; one example of this is a contract that simulates a currency, and another is a contract that records membership in a particular organization.</p><p>- Serve as a sort of externally owned account with a more complicated access policy; this is called a ""forwarding contract"" and typically involves simply resending incoming messages to some desired destination only if certain conditions are met; for example, one can have a forwarding contract that waits until two out of a given three private keys have confirmed a particular message before resending it (ie. multisig). More complex forwarding contracts have different conditions based on the nature of the message sent; the simplest use case for this functionality is a withdrawal limit that is overrideable via some more complicated access procedure.</p><p>- Manage an ongoing contract or relationship between multiple users. Examples of this include a financial contract, an escrow with some particular set of mediators, or some kind of insurance. One can also have an open contract that one party leaves open for any other party to engage with at any time; one example of this is a contract that automatically pays a bounty to whoever submits a valid solution to some mathematical problem, or proves that it is providing some computational resource.</p><p>- Provide functions to other contracts; essentially serving as a software library.</p><p>Contracts interact with each other through an activity that is alternately called either ""calling"" or ""sending messages"". A ""message"" is an object containing some quantity of ether (a special internal currency used in Ethereum with the primary purpose of paying transaction fees), a byte-array of data of any size, the addresses of a sender and a recipient. When a contract receives a message it has the option of returning some data, which the original sender of the message can then immediately use. In this way, sending a message is exactly like calling a function.</p>",Ethereum (ETH),7605,/media/20646/eth_logo.png,,,1523815911,Ethereum,229853385248732.34,0.0,PoW,30/07/2015,ETH,"<p><strong>Sandwich complexity model</strong>: the bottom level architecture of Ethereum should be as simple as possible, and the interfaces to Ethereum (including high level programming languages for developers and the user interface for users) should be as easy to understand as possible.

The IOTA Tangle is a quantum-proof Directed Acyclic Graph, with no fees on transactions &amp; no fixed limit on how many transactions can be confirmed per second in the network. Instead, throughput grows in conjunction with activity in the network; the more activity, the faster the network. Unlike blockchain architecture, IOTA has no separation between users and validators; rather, validation is an intrinsic property of using the ledger, thus avoiding centralization. IOTA is initially focused on serving as the backbone of the emerging Internet-of-Things (IoT). For a more in depth look at the technical design of IOTA read their <span style=""font-weight: 400;""><a href=""https://iota.org/IOTA_Whitepaper.pdf"">https://iota.org/IOTA_Whitepaper.pdf</a>. </span></span></p>",,Webpagecoinp,"<p><strong>Micro transactions </strong></p><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">For the first time ever true micro and even nano-transactions are enabled due to the unique IOTA Tangle architecture, providing developers with a brand new set of tools for their applications in both IoT and Web. This nurtures brand new business opportunities for companies that prohibitive fees has kept in the realm of the impossible until now.</span></p><p><strong>Data transfer</strong></p><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Core feature of IOTA is the ability to transfer data through the Tangle.

All data which is transferred through IOTA is fully authenticated and tamper-proof - making attacks impossible.</span></p><p><strong>Voting </strong></p><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Although IOTA is uniquely suited for the Internet-of-Things, the Tangle enables a variety of different use cases that involve secure data transmission, especially for eGovernance. An important part of this sector is e-Voting.

Easily transferable for a quick turnover without the need of intermediary brokers, the OMC asset will be the choice dividend vehicle for investors around the globe. Biweekly dividends ensure that no matter the price of the asset, the asset owner always will receive a 0.00001% share of the dividend pool, per Omicron, every 2 weeks.</span><br /><br /><br /><strong>How are BTC dividend-yields accrued and issued?</strong><br /><br /><span>BTC dividends will be funded every 2 weeks through trading on the volatile altcoin market as well as lending capital for margin-trading exchanges (stable interest). The loan interest guarantees a biweekly issuance of dividends, while the altcoin trading revenue is a major bonus, many times greater than loan yields. The trading yields aren&#39;t guaranteed biweekly as there may be an occurrence where there is a net loss during the timeframe. A minimum balance of 10,000 OMC in an address will be required to qualify for dividend yields. A BTC address must be associated with the OMC address, which will be done through the main website, and soon through the Omicron client itself.</span></span></p>",1 block,Webpagecoinp,"<p><strong>Transparency and Solvency</strong><br /><br /><span>Trust is a major issue in the unregulated industry that cryptocurrency is.

Independent audits by high profile members of the Bitcoin community will be allowed every 2-3 months to make sure that data provided biweekly is accurate and not forged or modified in any way.</span><br /><br /><br /><strong>Quick turnover and a market</strong><br /><br /><span>Omicron will be the first dividend-issuing asset that will be able to be traded on popular cryptocurrency exchanges. The quick turn over on exchanges will make OMC a superior investment vehicle than any existing dividend-issuing company today.

It was developed from the previous PoS  blockchain, Xaurum (XAU) which was migrated to the Ethereum platform to lower costs and inflation associated wwith mantaining a Proof of Stake 2.0 cryptocurrency.</p><p>Xaurum is gold backed crypto asset, that derives its value from the gold reserves maintained by the Auresco Institute, a non-profit organization created by the Xaurum team. Xaurum is ment to be used as a store of value since the gold base that backs Xaurum is always growing.</p><p>The former cryptocurrency, Xaurum (XAU) had an ICO period, in which 1016 XAU coins were sold. In the RICO period, these XAU coins are exchangeable for XAUR at a 1-8000 rate. During this RICO period, anyone was also allowed to send cryptocurrencies and fiat currencies to the Auresco Institute to recieve newly created XAUR. </p><p>In this smart contract system, the old PoS XAU coins that were swapped and the ones that were minted in the RICO period will be in circulation (all of these coins have been backed by gold), and the remaining supply is locked (the locked supply is not backed by gold). Xaurum users have two ways of acquiring tokens, you can earn them in the ""Goldmine"" or Mint them. </p><p>When mining on the Goldmine, users are exchanging their hashpower in a multipool. The earned coins from staking and mining these cryptocurrencies is used to buy more gold and to release Xaurum that was previously locked into circulation, by backing it with the newly bought gold. The proceeds from the Multipool can also be used to buy Xaurum in an exchange and pay the miners, depending on the market value of Xaurum, mined cryptocurrencies and the gold itself. </p><p>when Minting new coins, users are allowed to send fiat currencies directly to the Auresco Institute in exchange for new coins. These users are called Masternodes but they do not mantain the blockchain. Instead, they are required to have a 1000 XAUR collateral (like Dash masternodes), in order to create new coins. This ensures that any fraud attempt would not be profitable for the Xaurum masternodes.</p><p>Profits from running the PoW multipool and from the Minting process are sent to the Commonwealth wallet, and allow the Xaurum system to increase their gold supply at a must faster pace than the XAUR supply itself.</p>",,Webpagecoinp,,Xaurum (XAUR),25082,/media/351382/xaur.png,,,1523815897,Xaurum,0.0,0.0,,18/08/2016,XAUR,,127108472.4829,0.0,@urumproject,/coins/xaur/,,<a href='http://www.xaurum.org/' target='_blank'>Xaurum</a>,http://www.xaurum.org/,2016-08-18,

Transaction confirmations are fast due to the 60 second block time and the difficulty retargetting is every block based on DigiShield. The one percent premine is used in the Nautlius stabilisation fund to ensure liquidity in the market.</p><p>As pointed out by the Bank of England in its Quarterly Bulletin 2014 Q3 “The Economics of Digital Currencies”, Bitcoin faces three challenges: 1) Volatility 2) Sustainability of Low Transaction Fees 3) Limitations of a Fixed Money Supply. Nautiluscoin was designed to address and eliminate the challenges faced by Bitcoin.</p><p>he Nautiluscoin Stability Fund seeks to reduce volatility, while the Proof of Stake algorithm does away with the need for expensive mining equipment. Additionally, at the heart of the Proof of Stake reward calculation is an algorithmic monetary policy that adjusts money supply with demand.</p><p>The Nautiluscoin economy is built on the foundation of a strong currency policy and the view that a strong economy requires a currency which preserves purchasing power. Creating a fertile environment for an economy to develop requires the continuous pursuit of stability. But the pursuit of stability is not just about reducing daily price fluctuations.</p><p>For Nautiluscoin to be truly successful it must preserve and increase purchasing power. Daily price stability is important for consumers and merchants to transact, but the long run success of any currency is a function of purchasing power. If users of a currency believe that their ability to purchase goods and services in the future will be diminished then they are less likely to hold and use the currency. Therefore the most important goal for Nautiluscoin will be to maintain a strong currency with a stable and growing purchasing power.</p><p>In order to accomplish its strong currency goal, Nautiluscoin will compete with economics. Traditionally central banks with a strong currency policy are charged with providing an anchor for the economy through the use of money supply targets, interest rate targets, and/or exchange rate targets. Economic history has shown that these targets require the central bank to have significant resources in order to credibly accomplish the targets. Most successful targeting policies rely on an unlimited resource which is classically the ability to print or borrow money. In the case of Nautiluscoin, the terminal money supply is fixed by the software code and there are not public debt markets to use as an interest rate targets. However, this does not mean it lacks arrows in the quiver.</p><p>Because the terminal money supply is fixed and released over time we have the ability to set the growth rate of the money supply. As well, the Nautiluscoin network will be secured through proof-of-stake method which will pay interest to those who desire to hold Nautiluscoin.

The developers will mine the first 100 blocks or so before releasing the code + miner to the public.  Other than these first blocks, there is no premine for siacoins. The first block reward will be 300,000 siacoins. Each block reward after that will be one siacoin smaller than the previous block reward (299,999, then 299,998, and so on). When the block reward reaches 30,000, all remaining blocks will give a 30,000 siacoin reward. The block time is 10 minutes. Each siacoin is composed of 10^24 indivisible units.</p><p>The most important features of Sia can only be accessed by using siacoins. All storage contracts and all Sia payment channels require owning siacoins. This requirement means that as Sia grows in usage, so too will demand for siacoins. As demand grows, the price will increase. If Sia is being used for billions of dollars of storage, billions of dollars of siacoins will be required. The value of the siacoin is inextricably tied to the amount of storage in use on the Sia network.</p><p>Sia has a second cryptocurrency, called the Siafund. 3.9% of all successful storage contract payouts go to the holders of the siafunds. There are 10,000 siafunds total, and all 10,000 are completely premined. Sia&#39;s parent company, Nebulous Inc., holds approximately 8750 of these siafunds. The remaining siafunds were sold in a crowdfund which helped to finance Sia&#39;s early development. The primary goal of siafunding is to provide a way to finance the development of Sia without relying on donations or a premine.

The way to make money directly through Bitcoin is to predict its future price.

For the time being, there are only three ways to generate transaction fees: arbitrary messages, WCG transfers and aliases. But as WCG adds more features, each of the WCG accounts that are forged will continue to increase. As WCG has a practical mechanism to get more new features through its voting system, it is hoped that the community would agree to add more promising new features, to correspond to the increase of transaction fees and WCG&#39;s real interest rate. By combining all these features with a scalable framework, WCG has become the foundation of a well-established and mature peer-to-peer economy.

1700,,Scrypt,/coins/arch/,-1,0.0,,0,,"<p>The original ARCH whitepaper focused on the concept of controlling the flow of information within a decentralized autonomous corporation (DAC) in an effort to promote financial stability and growth within a DAC and protecting sensible information. While most cryptocurrencies are created as an alternative to bitcoin, ARCH was created as a startup holding DAC whose equity is represented by a cryptographic token. The goal is to test new applications of blockchain technology as well as to model an investor-token relationship in a use-case scenario involving a real startup with palpable products and services. To improve equity fungibility, revenue from any of the holding company&#39;s products or services is to be used to purchase more tokens from the market, thereby making the holding DAC&#39;s equity token exponentially more valuable with each additional revenue stream. Although no substantial revenue has been injected into ARCH&#39;s fungibility yet, its tiered conditional access levels have created a natural self-audit system that has proven very effective when it comes to managing this pseudo-corporate setup and its investors. Value in information is trusted to investors according to their own responsibility in the pseudo-corporate structure. In this tiered setup, the amount of tokens held serves as a basis of evaluating trust and involvement with the DAC itself. This system promotes unbiased transparency by the developers and corporate responsibility on behalf of the investors. This system alone, without any major revenue stream, has already proven itself as the backbone of the current stable growth in the ARCH equity token&#39;s market cap.</p><p><br /><span>This unique approach opens doors for a new generation of DACs, fusing decentralized communities with traditional corporate structures using tiered conditional access levels to secure the flow of information. Although tailored to our specific ventures and “community” needs, the ARCH wallet concept is an outstanding, first-of-its-kind example for other future DACs looking to combine all relevant information and tools regarding the DAC&#39;s and its equity token in one place. ARCH is taking that concept even further and seeks to integrate the whole corporate structure into its wallet as the DAC grows. </span><br /><br /><span>In a nutshell, Arch rearranged how investors interacted in DACs to establish healthier lines of communication while changing the financial structure so that FIAT revenue would be injected directly into the tokens fungibility instead of being distributed through dividends.</span><br /><br /><span>Their products, services and software are inspired by bitcoin, disruptive and innovative but not interdependent.</span></p>",,Webpagecoinp,,ArchCoin (ARCH),4331,/media/20085/arch.png,,,1504105754,ArchCoin,0.0,0.0,PoS,22/10/2014,ARCH,,16403135,0.0,@ARCHcoin,/coins/arch/,,<a href='https://www.archcoin.co/' target='_blank'>ArchCoin</a>,https://www.archcoin.co/,2014-10-22,

This minimal friction is key for user adoption. NeuCoin will put a heavy focus on conversion-driven marketing, with game-like tutorials and interactive onboarding that qualifies, educates and rewards users - with no tech to read or understand and no personal information or money down to get started. Finally, social referral programs will reward free NeuCoin tokens to people who help recruit other users; special programs and bounties will be available for people active in the crypto community, influential bloggers and content creators, celebrity endorsers, etc.Rewarding Early Adopters People who get in early on NeuCoin - who help create the first core of users and holders - will be highly rewarded for adding this value. NeuCoin’s economic model uses very high PoS awards, starting at 100% per year in year one, 80% in year two and gradually declining to 6% by year ten, meaning that coin holdings will multiply by up to 50X over 10 years with non-stop PoS mining.Transparency and GovernanceNeuCoin will be open, accountable and ultimately controlled by coin holders. NeuCoin’s core code development, user growth programs, and projects to increase utility will be supported by three non-profit foundations based in Isle of Man: the Code, Growth and Utility foundations. All foundations are ultimately controlled by NeuCoin holders (1 NeuCoin = 1 vote), who have the power to hire, fire and set compensation for the foundations’ Council Members, and have a right of approval on annual budgets, spending priorities and other matters. This structure makes NeuCoin more decentralized and accountable than Bitcoin, Ripple or Stellar, let alone most of the anonymous alt coins out there. "
